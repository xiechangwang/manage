This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

1 、首先需要暴露webpack配置 npm run eject，这个时候就会生成config和script两个文件夹
2、npm install less less-loader antd babel-plugin-import
3、在config/webpack.config.js文件中添加如下代码

    const cssRegex = /\.css$/;
    const cssModuleRegex = /\.module\.css$/;

    const sassRegex = /\.(scss|sass)$/;
    const sassModuleRegex = /\.module\.(scss|sass)$/;

    添加如下代码 照葫芦画瓢
    const lessRegex = /\.less$/;   
    const lessModuleRegex = /\.module\.less$/;

    ###在module/rules下添加  注意层级，不要弄错
            {
              test: lessRegex,
              exclude: lessModuleRegex,
              use: getStyleLoaders(
                  {
                    importLoaders: 2,
                    sourceMap: isEnvProduction && shouldUseSourceMap,
                  },
                  'less-loader'
              ),
              // Don't consider CSS imports dead code even if the
              // containing package claims to have no side effects.
              // Remove this when webpack adds a warning or an error for this.
              // See https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/6571
              sideEffects: true,
            },
            // Adds support for CSS Modules, but using SASS
            // using the extension .module.scss or .module.sass
            {
              test: lessModuleRegex,
              use: getStyleLoaders(
                  {
                    importLoaders: 2,
                    sourceMap: isEnvProduction && shouldUseSourceMap,
                    modules: true,
                    getLocalIdent: getCSSModuleLocalIdent,
                  },
                  'less-loader'
              ),
            },

4、在package.json中添加以下代码
            "babel": {
              "presets": [
                "react-app"
              ],
              "plugins": [
                [
                  "import",
                  {
                    "libraryName": "antd",
                    "style": "css"
                  }
                ]
              ]
            }
